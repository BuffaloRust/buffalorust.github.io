# Buffalo Rust

Buffalo Rust is the GitHub organization for the [Buffalo Rust Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Buffalo-Rust-Meetup/).

We use this repo for any standing resources we regularly share at meetings.

You can view the repo on GitHub here:

## Rust User Group

Our primary meetup is the Rust User Group, which meets every first Tuesday of each Month virtually. You can find the next one on [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Buffalo-Rust-Meetup/)!

This is a discussion oriented meetup, which follows a rough agenda:

 - Introductions
 - Questions about Rust
 - Presentations
 - Open Discussion

All are welcome, regardless of location and prior Rust experience! We talk about everything from lifetimes, async, networking, operating systems, game dev, and functional programming.
